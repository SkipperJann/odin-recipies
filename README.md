Recipe Page ⭐️
Create a recipe page to showcase basic HTML.

Thoughts 💭
This was my very first assignment with the updated Odin Project curriculum. I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, input headers, paragraphs, images, and links. Alongside, I was able to create ordered and unordered lists for my recipes.  I tried to produce clean code so it is readable and understandable to any viewer. I wanted to center the images so I did some google, google, google and came up with imbedded css style to move things around and I also created image thumbnails for the index page.

I plan to use https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21551/quick-quiche/ next
