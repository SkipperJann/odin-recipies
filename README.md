# Recipe Page ‚≠êÔ∏è
Assign: Create a recipe page to showcase basic HTML. Include 3 recipies. 
I'm using recipies from https://www.allrecipes.com/ , recommended in the lesson plan.

# Running comentary (newest on top):

For lunch I plan to use https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21551/quick-quiche/ . 
I got the second recipe added that's just like the french toast recipe and started NOT! liking the look of my index page, so I created thumbnails of the images of img on recipe pages and made them clickable. I copied this recipe into third spot on index page as a pace holder, I'll flesh it out in next effort. Blogs I looked at dicouraged using &emsp; and the like to create space around the images, so I went with style padding. Want to see how my pages work on iPhone etc.

First there's breakfast. I'm using https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7016/french-toast-i/ from allrecipes.com
I put together an index page with clickable text for the recipe name and borrowed a couple ideas for forward/backward navigation. Found how to style the images to center them and placed text on img with textedit.

# Thoughts üí≠
This was my very first assignment with the updated Odin Project curriculum; I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, input headers, paragraphs, images, and links. I created ordered and unordered lists for my recipes.  
I tried to produce clean code so it is readable and understandable to any viewer. Also, I wanted to center my images so I did some google, google, google and came up with imbedded css style to center imgages and I also created image thumbnails for the index page.

** I really liked the readme file of Stefan T and have adapted it, thank you hope you're flattered. j

OMG! Just realized I've been mispelling "recipes"!!! Not sure how extensive to fix. I'll get on that right awaaaaaay, yeah right
