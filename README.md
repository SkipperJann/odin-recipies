# Recipe Page
Assign: Create a recipe page to showcase basic HTML. Include 3 recipes. 
I'm using recipes from https://www.allrecipes.com/ as recommended in the lesson plan. I don't cook at all IRL so...

# Running comentary (newest on top):

Ok dinner time, it's time to make another Margarita which should go well with enchiladas: 
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/229123/best-beef-enchiladas/  
Got those nutrition facts in all the recipe pages. I'll go back and add more comments in html files cause I'm bad at keeping up with them. Thinking about where to put recipe attributions on recipe pages. If I don't quit thinking up new tweeks I'll never finish.

Thought I'd throw in an adult beverage

structure here is prety much a duplicate of breakfast and lunch recipes ... added nutrition facts on this page and need to add to other recipes for consistency. I plan to add a dinner menu to round out, just saying.

For lunch I want to keep my carbs down so I think a nice crustless quiche:

I got the second recipe added that's just like the french toast recipe and started NOT liking the look of my index page, so I created thumbnails of the images on the recipe pages and made them clickable on the index page. I copied this recipe into third spot on index page as a pace holder, I'll flesh it out in next effort. Blogs I looked at dicouraged using & emsp; (sic) and the like to create space around the images, so I went with style padding. I want to see how my pages work on iPhone etc.

First there's breakfast. My fav is French Toast, nothing fancy. I'm using: 
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7016/french-toast-i/ from allrecipes.com.
I put together an index page with clickable text for the recipe name and borrowed a couple ideas for forward/backward navigation. Found how to style the images to center them and placed text on img with textedit.

# Thoughts
This was my very first assignment with the Odin Project curriculum; I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, input headers, paragraphs, images, and links. I created ordered and unordered lists for my recipes.
I tried to produce clean code so it is readable and understandable to any viewer. Also, I wanted to center my images so I did some google, google, google and came up with imbedded css style to center imgages and I also created image thumbnails for the index page.

** I really liked the readme file of Stefan T and have adapted it, thank you, hope you're flattered. j

OMG! Just realized I've been mispelling "recipes"!!! EVERYWHERE! Not sure how extensive to fix. I'll get on that right awaaaaaay, yeah right
