I reaslly liked the readme file of Stefan T and have adapted it, thank you hope you're flattered. j

# Recipe Page ‚≠êÔ∏è
Assign: Create a recipe page to showcase basic HTML. Include 3 recipies. 

I'm using recipies from https://www.allrecipes.com/ , recommended in the lesson plan.

First there's breakfast. I'm using https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7016/french-toast-i/ from allrecipes.com

For lunch I plan to use https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21551/quick-quiche/

# Thoughts üí≠
This was my very first assignment with the updated Odin Project curriculum; I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, input headers, paragraphs, images, and links. I created ordered and unordered lists for my recipes.  
I tried to produce clean code so it is readable and understandable to any viewer. Also, I wanted to center my images so I did some google, google, google and came up with imbedded css style to center imgages and I also created image thumbnails for the index page.

OMG! Just realized I've been mispelling "recipes"!!! Not sure how extensive to fix
